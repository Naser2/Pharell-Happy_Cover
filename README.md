Pharrell has provided us with the text for the album and all the legal
mumbo-jumbo to give credit where credit is due. You can find that text in
`SOURCE.md`. Again, this is a typical industry standard workflow, where the
developers are given copy for the site from the product team.

Each line of text in this file corresponds to a note in `index.html` that will
indicate where you'll need to add this information. It will be up to you to pick
which HTML tags to use.
